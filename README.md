## Aims
The main goal of the Persistent Kingdoms mod is to bring freshness into Persistent Worlds (PW) by adding new features, while still keeping the mechanics of the original PW, which was made brilliantly by Vornne & his team. Such features include but are not limited to:

- Adding new armours, horses and weapons
- Adding new scene props
- Adding & editing some of the features
- Implementing graphical changes
- Improving the log system
- Adding RP aspects/items
- Fixing bugs & glitches

It's our goal to make this "the next PW" which is why we're working closely with the community to bring in the changes they want.
